                <h2>The Self Driving Car</h2>
                <h3>Self driving cars are vehicles that are piloted by a computer rather than a human driver.Even though the technology hasn't even been available to the general public yet, people have voiced concerns about the safety and potential risks of making this technology widespread. </h3>

                    <h2> Concerns</h2>
                    <h3> Without a human driver, people worry that an AI won't be able to have the same human-like reflexes and be able to react accordingly to high stress situations. Similarly an ethical question pops up when the topic of what a self-driving vehicle should do in the case of saving a pedestrian or risking the life of the passenger and several other qualities that a human might be able to make, but in the hands of a computer, many people would criticize its judgement. At an economic standpoint, the existence of self-driving cars could serve to completely derail the taxi/ride-share market.</h3>

                <h2> Benefits</h2>
                    <h3>The benefits of self-driving cars outweigh the risks. Removing human error, such as tiredness, or being under the influence from the equation, make self-driving cars much safer, especially if a majority of cars on the road are self-driving. </h3>
